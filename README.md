the final code of online manual
this system realize the basic functionalities of a online manual system, for instance, login with personal account, read manual content by 
chapter. and for the teachers in dentistry school, more functionalities can be used to digitalize their work, such as publish notification,
upload documents and edit exist manual or create new manual... and the system still need to be upgraded due to the functionalities are limited
which can not match the higher demand. 

the code of login functionality is used by another programmer which I have cite in my dissertation, and the rest of the system is based on 
this login example.
